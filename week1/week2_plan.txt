WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Olivia Jezior
Date: 05/02/2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: A lot of the data points arent in a standard format, ie. some are all caps,
some have random spaces, some have spelling mistakes.

Which tutorial provides the solution: 3, strings

Which variable(s) affected: site and treatment 

Why this is important to fix: having all the names be in a similar formate means that calculations
and graph creations will be easier and accurate
What I plan to do: change all the names to one, easy, standard format.



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: The NA values. Need to figure out if they are relevant or if they can just be removed

Which tutorial provides the solution: 5, missing data

Which variable(s) affected: collector, eggs laid, body mass

Why this is important to fix: the data may or may not be significant when doing calculations

What I plan to do: identify if its necessary and either remove or keep it
 


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - checking if dates are all imm correct format]
- [Issue 4 - odd body mass values]
- [Issue 5 - titles, they arent bad. they are clear and don't necessarily need to be changed ]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. is over 100mg too heavy for a mosquito?
