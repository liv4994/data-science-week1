TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x ] YES - Question #(s): yes my text variables arent as clean as they could be,
   and i do have character and text variables/
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [x ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [ x] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [x ] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: str_to_upper
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - female_id
   - age days
   - etc etc
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - Female ID
   - Age (days)
   - 


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

NA
   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________



================================================================================
TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   that the data is not relevant to any caluclations being made
   
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ ] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [ x] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable:body mass | Percent missing: _____%
   Variable: collector | Percent missing: _____%
   Variable: eggs laid | Percent missing: _____%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [x ] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [ ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have? 
this will help when doing caclulations and knowing when to consider NA values,
if ever

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [x ] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [x ] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: date
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 2023-05-23
   - 
   - 
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 23-05-2023
   - 
   - 


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY
   
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   dates and orders could all get mixed and cause confusion 
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   check for impossible values


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ x] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): are any mosquito masses in grams below zero? have we laid negative eggs?
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: body mass
   
   Minimum value: -92mg  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ x] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: 108mg | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ ] No [x ] Unsure
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [ x] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): does treatment affect eggs?
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related (e.g., body length and body mass,
   sex and reproductive status, species and location):

   Variable 1: treatment
   Variable 2: eggs laid
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [ x] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   as treatment increases, so should egg laying 


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [ ] Convert one variable to NA (which one? _________)
   [ x] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   dont delete data, but keep it fror future so it can be investigated when performing calculations
